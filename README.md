# generator-university [![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url] [![Dependency Status][daviddm-image]][daviddm-url]
> A generator for creating LaTeX based university documents.

## Installation

First, install [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and generator-university using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (we assume you have pre-installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)).

```bash
npm install -g yo
npm install -g generator-university
```

Then generate your new project:

```bash
yo university
```

Assuming that a LaTeX suite has been installed and is available on your $PATH, the document can be compiled:
```bash
latexmk -f -pdf
```
This will produce the file ```main.pdf```.
